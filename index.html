							<h1>Mental Health and Mental Illness on University Campuses.</h1>
							
							<p> Mental health issues are a significant barrier to academic success and happiness among college students. While help is available, there is an unnecessary shame surrounding these issues and on top of this, services have proven to be inadequate. As a result, mental health is not discussed enough and a large portion of students suffer alone. In order to provide sufficient services to their sudents, universities must focus on developing accessible and thorough resources, while working to eradicate the stigma of mental illness.</p> <u><h4>This website will explore methods to provide pro-active campus-wide support and to eradicate the stigma surrounding mental illness. </h4></u>

						<h2 class="text-white">
						1. Inadequate Resources
						</h2>
						<div class="banner-content">
						<p class="text-white">Unfortunately, most counseling centers work with restricted resources. In the US, the average university has one educated counselor for every 1800 students which is fewer than 1 counselor for every 1,000 to 1,500 students recommended by the International Association of Counseling Services. </p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-12">
					<img src="a2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid float-left mr-20 mb-20">
						<p class="text-white">As colleges are unable to grow at the same rate as students seeking help, some students are slipping through the cracks due to long waits for treatment and a lasting stigma associated with mental health issues. Even if students ask for and receive help, not all cases can be treated on campus. As a result, many professional off-campus centers are stepping in, but at the expense of the student and his/her/their family. These professional program can amount to more than $10,000 per year and are many times not covered by health insurance. However, especially in rural areas, where options for off-campus care are limited, universities are feeling pressure to do more.</p>

						<p class="text-white">The NAMI 2016 research discovered that over the last 10 years universities have increased resources devoted to rapid-access services in response to rising demand from students — including walk-in appointments and crisis treatment for students demonstrating signs of distress. But long-term treatment services, including recurring appointments and specialized counseling, decreased on average during that time period. However, there is still a great need for more. 
</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
					<h2 class="text-white">
						2. The Stigma
						</h2>
						<div class="banner-content">
<p class="text-white">People with mental illness are a part of one of the most stigmatized groups in American culture. Many of the over 45 million people in the US who suffer from some type of mental health disorder may describe and define stigma using one of these words or phrases: hate, discrimination, prejudice, fear inducing, humiliating, hurtful. </p>
</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-12">
					<iframe width="480" height="315" alt="" class="iframe-fluid float-left mr-20 mb-20" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKeespQytpE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</iframe>
						<p class="text-white">Stigma is directly tied to discrimination and hate. Often, those with mental illness are portrayed as violent, incompetent and disdainful. Perpetuation of hurtful and inaccurate stereotypes by the media is especially harmful because of the profound role it has in shaping and influencing social mores and attitudes. Whether consciously or not, the community as a whole ingests these negative attitudes, which they then use to stigmatize those with mental disorders.As a result, people struggling with mental health challenges may not get the help they need for fear they’ll be discriminated against.</p>

						<p class="text-white">
						Mental illness stigma has been identified by national policy makers as an important barrier to help seeking for mental health. According to a study by the National Alliance on Mental Illness, stigma remains the number one barrier to students seeking help. As a result of public stigma, personal stigma arrises which is when people with mental illness internalize the negative perceptions and stereotypes. This can result in even more severe mental illness.  </p>

						<p class="text-white">They should be proactive in connecting students to help and encouragng them to seek help. Faculty should address mental health in the classroom. They should understand that students living with mental health conditions can be succesful even if they need to complete the work in different ways. </p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="fh5co-person text-left ">
						<h3 class="text-white">Educate Students/Peers</h3>
						
						<p class="text-white">Students should be aware that having mental illness is more common that they think and they are not alone. Peer support is extremely important and they should try to be emphatetic, aware, and patient. Students can and should get regular mental health checkups just like physical checkups. </p>
						<p class="text-white"> Students should know the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions. Be conscious of changes in sleep patters, eating habits, behaviors, perceptions, and social interactions. Mental health conditions are treatable and help is available. It is okay to seek help.

							<p>Few would argue that, despite the advancements of feminism over the past three decades, women still face a double standard when it comes to their behavior. While men’s borderline-inappropriate behavior is often laughed off as “boys will be boys,” women face higher conduct standards – especially in the workplace. That’s why it’s crucial that, as women, our behavior on the job is beyond reproach.Small Towns and Big StatesFor </p>

This bot would allow students immediate assistance and also is built to allow the various groups on campus to connect from the other side and write directly to the student. If implemented, this could give WUSTL students truly 24/7 assistance.</h5>
